Issue: Need a way to import imgs to the card component that match the planet's name
Solution: -Build a web API that has the img links loaded into a JSON file
	  -Write a function that matches the name from the img API to the name of the info 	   API from SWAPI 
	  -Link the result of that function into the "src" value of the IMG element of the 	   Card.js component

~~~~still need to learn how to build API and integrate functions into React~~~~~

Progress: (as of 4.30.19):
- Using express, node, and postman we can create our own databases. We can also integrate functions into the main App.js document using a constructor and referencing "this.state" to make sure the function is executed while searching for cards on planets.

Idea: Populate image database using automation to actually pull from all 61 entires of the api 
Solution: -Learn how to build a program that will scan the web for images matching the 		   name of each planet and choose a photo that fits certain parameters based on 	   size, position of the planet in the photo, and brightness/ planet clairty.
	  -find an api that has the flexibility to control certain parameters(ClariFai is 	   a strong possibility

Note: URLs need to be stored in the Database as strings after https:// due to sql reading the ":" as a commmand. When linking the images to pull from the database the code needs to read as src=`https://${planets[${id}]}
